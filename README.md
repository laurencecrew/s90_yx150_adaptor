"# s90_yx150_adaptor" 

** Adaptor brackets for 196x Honda S90 frame to YX-150 or similar engine

Please see Solidworks files for full details of the assembly. I have not included drawings of the various mounting tubes except in the Solidworks files.

The engine adaptor bracket consists of 2 side plates from 3.2mm steel, 3 frame mounting tubes (the original engine bolts run through these) and 2 engine mounting tubes (which run through the mounting points of the YX-150 engine).

Note that the left hand side plate has a bent offset section in it. The PDF drawing is a side view of the finished part and the DXF is the unfolded flat pattern. The right hand side plate is flat.

The frame mounting tubes are brazed or welded through the side plates.

The engine mounting tubes each connect 2 shoulder bolts with an M6x1 internal thread. I used 4 x Honda brake master cylinder lever pivot bolts, part # 90114-MA5-671

There is also an adaptor bracket to join the original foot peg assembly to the mounting holes in the bottom of the YX-150 casing. This assembly also includes turned bosses that should be brazed or welded to the flat section (see Solidworks files).
