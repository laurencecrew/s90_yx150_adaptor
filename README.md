# Adaptor brackets for 196x Honda S90 frame to YX-150 or similar engine

Please see Solidworks files for full details of the assembly. I have not included drawings of the various mounting tubes except in the Solidworks files.

The engine adaptor bracket consists of
* 2 side plates from 3.2mm steel
* 3 frame mounting tubes (the original engine bolts run through these), and
* 2 engine mounting tubes (which run through the mounting points of the YX-150 engine).

Note that the left hand side plate has a bent offset section in it. The PDF drawing is a side view of the finished part and the DXF is the unfolded flat pattern. The right hand side plate is flat.

The frame mounting tubes shoud be brazed or welded to the side plates.

The engine mounting tubes each connect 2 shoulder bolts with an M6x1 internal thread. I used 4 x Honda brake master cylinder lever pivot bolts, part # 90114-MA5-671

The holes in the side plates should be counterbored to allow the bolt heads to be almost flush and fit inside the frame.

There is also an adaptor bracket to join the original foot peg assembly to the mounting holes in the bottom of the YX-150 casing. This assembly also includes turned bosses that should be brazed or welded to the flat section (see Solidworks files).

## Frame modifications

In my case the S90 frame was unmodified except for a small cutaway (half of a 12mm round) to clear one of the screw bosses on the motor. This corresponds with the 12mm diameter cutaway on the right hand side plate.

## Improvements

Shoulder bolts with countersunk heads might cause less stress than the counterbored ones, if any could be found. I think it is best to use shoulder bolts that go through the side plates straight into the motor mounting holes rather than just M6 countersunk screws for example.

A bracket could be welded on to hold the ignition coil in the space on top of the motor, under the frame. I made a clamp on bracket but I never made any drawings of it.
